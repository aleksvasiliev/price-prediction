# BTC 10s Guess - Version 1.0 Summary

## 📋 Overview
Casual browser-based Web3 game where players predict Bitcoin price movements over 10-second intervals. Built as a monorepo with React frontend, Node.js backend, and real-time WebSocket communication.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
```
predictor/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React frontend (Vite + TypeScript)
│   └── server/       # Node.js backend (Fastify + WebSocket)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/       # Common types and events (dual CJS/ESM)
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, WebSocket, TypeScript
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for game events and price updates
- **Storage**: CSV files with file locking (players.csv, sessions.csv, rounds.csv)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Web3**: MetaMask SDK, ethers.js, SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum)

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 🎮 Core Game Mechanics
- **10-second prediction rounds** with real-time countdown timer
- **UP/DOWN betting** on BTC price direction
- **Anti-cheat protection** - betting closes 250ms before round end
- **Points system** - +10 points for correct predictions
- **Guest mode** - play without wallet connection
- **Session management** - persistent user sessions

### 📊 Price Data & UI
- **Real-time BTC prices** from Binance WebSocket API
- **Mock price generator** for development/testing
- **Price updates** every second during rounds
- **Beautiful gradient UI** with smooth animations
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Chart placeholder** showing current price (ready for full chart integration)

### 🔗 Web3 Integration
- **MetaMask wallet connection** with proper browser polyfills
- **SIWE authentication** framework (ready for implementation)
- **Wallet state management** - connect/disconnect functionality
- **Session linking** - associate wallets with game sessions

### 🌐 Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket events** for all game interactions:
  - `ROUND_START` - new round begins
  - `CHOICE_SUBMIT` - player makes prediction
  - `CHOICE_ACK` - server confirms choice
  - `ROUND_RESULT` - round outcome with points
  - `PRICE_UPDATE` - real-time price feeds
  - `WALLET_CONNECT` - MetaMask integration

### 💾 Data Persistence
- **CSV-based storage** with proper file locking
- **Player records** - wallet addresses, total points, games played
- **Session tracking** - temporary points, connection status
- **Round history** - complete audit trail of all game rounds
- **Automatic cleanup** - old sessions and file compaction

### 🛠️ Development Experience
- **Hot reload** for both frontend and backend
- **Dual module exports** - shared package works with both ES modules and CommonJS
- **Type safety** - full TypeScript coverage across all packages
- **Concurrent development** - run all services with single command
- **Error handling** - comprehensive error catching and logging

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### Module Resolution Issues
- **Problem**: Frontend (ES modules) couldn't import from backend-compatible shared package
- **Solution**: Implemented dual CommonJS/ES Module exports with proper build pipeline

### TypeScript Import Conflicts
- **Problem**: Runtime import errors with TypeScript interfaces
- **Solution**: Used `type`-only imports for interfaces, regular imports for constants

### Browser Compatibility
- **Problem**: MetaMask SDK required Node.js polyfills in browser
- **Solution**: Added process/buffer polyfills via Vite configuration

### Chart Library Integration
- **Problem**: `lightweight-charts` API conflicts and assertion errors
- **Solution**: Created simple price display placeholder (ready for future chart restoration)

## 📈 Game Statistics (from logs)
- **Active gameplay**: Players making UP/DOWN predictions
- **Round completion**: 10-second rounds running continuously
- **Price volatility**: BTC prices ranging from ~$44K to $60K+
- **Real-time updates**: Successful WebSocket connections and price feeds
- **Session management**: Multiple concurrent players supported

## 🚀 Deployment Ready
- **Health check endpoint**: `/api/health` for monitoring
- **State inspection**: `/api/state` for debugging
- **Leaderboard API**: `/api/leaderboard` for top players
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup on SIGINT
- **Production ports**: 3001 (backend), 5173 (development frontend)

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ Game is playable end-to-end
- ✅ Real-time price predictions working
